# Asteroid Hunting with synthetic data

In some sitiations, the data may be rare or hard to find. For this project I generated synthetic asteroid images using some open source and proprietary 3D software platforms. Object detection model was then trained with Azure Custom Vision solution and exported into TensorFlow format. It also generated a template class to perform predictions.
